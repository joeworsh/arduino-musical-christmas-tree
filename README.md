# Musical Christmas Tree

## A Festive Desktop Display

This repository contains an Arduino image and associated circuit design for a festive, musical desktop display to help get you and your co-workers into the Christmas spirit. The board includes an array of 8 LEDs and a string of mini Christmas tree lights which illuminate in rhythm to a set of Christmas songs played on a buzzer. The buzzer control is first passed through a potentiometer to control volume which is critical to maintaining a positive Christmas spirit for all (the buzzer can get very annoying).

Feel free to add other Christmas songs to the playlist.
